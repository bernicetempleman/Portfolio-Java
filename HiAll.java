    Variable names are case-sensitive.
     A variable's name can be
    â€” an unlimited-length sequence of letters and digits,
    beginn with a letter, the dollar sign "$", or the underscore character "_".
    Best to always begin your variable names with a letter,
     not "$" or "_".
     Additionally, the dollar sign character, by convention, is never used at all.

Subsequent characters may be letters, digits, dollar signs, or underscore characters.
Conventions (and common sense) apply to this rule as well.
When choosing a name for your variables,
use full words instead of cryptic abbreviations.
Doing so will make your code easier to read and understand.
In many cases it will also make your code self-documenting;
fields named cadence, speed, and gear,
 for example, are much more intuitive than abbreviated versions,
  such as s, c, and g.
   Also keep in mind that the name you choose must not be a keyword or reserved word.
If the name you choose consists of only one word,
spell that word in all lowercase letters.
If it consists of more than one word,
capitalize the first letter of each subsequent word.
 The names gearRatio and currentGear are prime examples of this convention.
 If your variable stores a constant value,
 such as static final int NUM_GEARS = 6,
  the convention changes slightly,
   capitalizing every letter and separating subsequent words with the underscore character.
   By convention, the underscore character is never used elsewhere.
